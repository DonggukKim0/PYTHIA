! 1) Settings used in the main program.
Main:numberOfEvents = 10000000        ! number of events to generate
Main:timesAllowErrors = 100        ! how many aborts before run stops


! 2) Settings related to output in init(), next() and stat().
Init:showChangedSettings = on      ! list changed settings
Init:showChangedParticleData = on ! list changed particle data
Next:numberCount = 1000             ! print message every n events
Next:numberShowInfo = 3            ! print event information n times
Next:numberShowProcess = 0         ! print process record n times
Next:numberShowEvent = 0           ! print event record n times
